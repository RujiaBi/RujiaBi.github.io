Welcome, my name is Rujia Bi. I am a Postdoc at the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison advised by Dr. Olaf Jensen. I am interested in spatiotemporal dynamics of fish populations, fisheries stock assessment and management. A main focus of my current research is to identify climate-vulnerable stock assessments and to recommend management actions that can effectively mitigate this risk.

I got my PhD at Virginia Tech, supervised by Dr. Yan Jiao. My dissertation focus on using Bayesian hierarchical approaches to analyze spatiotemporal dynamics of fish populations‚Äù.
